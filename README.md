# Name_detection_from_Resume_pdf_format
his Python code is designed to extract and identify person names from a PDF document. It uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text content from the PDF and the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library for natural language processing tasks.
Import necessary libraries:

PyPDF2: This library is used for working with PDF files, allowing text extraction from PDF documents.
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit is used for text processing and analysis.
Download NLTK resources:

The code downloads essential NLTK resources, including tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers, and word lists.
Define a function to extract text from a PDF document:

The extract_text_from_pdf function takes the path to a PDF document as input, reads the PDF file using PyPDF2, and iterates through its pages to extract text. The extracted text from all pages is concatenated into a single string and returned.
Define a function to extract person names from text:

The extract_names function takes the extracted text as input and uses NLTK for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).
It tokenizes the text into sentences and then tokenizes each sentence into words.
It performs part-of-speech tagging to identify the grammatical roles of words in each sentence.
It applies named entity recognition to identify entities like persons, organizations, and locations.
Specifically, it looks for entities labeled as 'PERSON,' indicating a person's name, and extracts these names.
Check if the script is being run as the main program:

The code uses if __name__ == '__main__': to ensure that the following code is executed only when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
Extract text from a PDF document:

It calls the extract_text_from_pdf function to extract text from a PDF document named 'Arnab.pdf' and stores the extracted text in the text variable.
Extract person names from the extracted text:

It calls the extract_names function with the extracted text as input and stores the list of person names in the names variable.
Print the first person name if any were found:

Finally, it checks if any person names were found (the names list is not empty), and if so, it prints the first person name in the list.
In summary, this code's main purpose is to extract and identify person names from a PDF document and print the first name found, if any. It utilizes NLTK for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, and uses PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction.
